# Cloud Pentesting Tools Guide

Welcome to the Cloud Pentesting Tools Guide repository! This guide aims to provide a comprehensive list of penetration testing tools that are specifically designed to work in cloud environments or targets deployed with a cloud environment.

## Introduction

With the increasing adoption of cloud services and infrastructure, security professionals and penetration testers need to have access to tools that can effectively assess the security posture of cloud-based systems. This repository serves as a curated collection of such tools, categorized by their functionalities and compatible cloud platforms.

## Tool Categories

The tools in this repository are organized into the following categories:

- **Recon and information gathering**: Tools for collecting information about the target before we start.
- **Network Scanning and Enumeration**: Tools for discovering assets, services, and vulnerabilities within cloud networks.
- **Web Application Testing**: Tools for assessing the security of web applications deployed in cloud environments.
- **Exploration and Situation awareness**: Tools that will help you discover the environment you are in once you can access/ hack your way in.
- **Vulnerability Assessment and Pentesting**: Tools for identifying and managing vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure and applications.
- **Exploitation && Attack**: Frameworks and tools for exploiting vulnerabilities found during penetration tests and also used for attacking.
- **Forensics and Incident Response**: Tools for investigating security incidents and performing digital forensics in cloud environments.
